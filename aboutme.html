        <h2>Kian LaMer</h2>
        <p>Hello fellow students my name is Kian LaMer and I am from Houston Texas in the Tomball area. I am the second oldest of 5 boys so it is always a party at my house. I was born in raised in different parts of Colorado so I love the snow and I love to Ski.</p>
        <p>I was not born in the church and I don't think I knew what church was until I was 6. My family joined the church when my parents got divorced in 2008 and my dad got remarried to my stepmom who has been a member her whole life. Even though we are a blended family we were all sealed together in the Salt Lake Temple in April of 2011. I love the gospel blessings of temples and families.</p>
        <p>I am curently majoring in computer science with a minor in spanish. I am very passionate about both of these and find them very interesting. I took 4 years of spanish in high school and recently returned from a spanish speaking mission in Los Angeles California three months ago. I love speaking spanish and listening to music like Bad Bunny, Morat, and Karol G. </p>
