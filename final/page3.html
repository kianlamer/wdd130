                    Advanced Techniques: Once you have mastered the basics, it's time to level up your cubing skills with advanced techniques.
                    This section will introduce you to various methods beyond the beginner's approach. You will discover the Fridrich method,
                    also known as CFOP, which is widely used by speedcubers worldwide. We will explore the intuitive F2L (First Two Layers) technique,
                    efficient OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer), and PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) algorithms.
                    By delving into these advanced techniques, you'll enhance your solving speed and efficiency, impressing friends and fellow cubers.
